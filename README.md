There are several network player on the market, 
which all based on proprietary software. 
Because of this proprietary the network player 
is mostly uncomfortable in use and it is not 
usable from every network device. To improve 
this weakness the goal of this project is to 
build a network player which is controllable 
via the Music Player Daemon (MPD). MPD uses a 
extreme simple protocol which based on ascii 
Strings. This simple protocol allows to 
interact via a telnet client with the mpd 
server. The network player will get a own hard 
drive and will be able to play internet radio 
and audio from other sources.
