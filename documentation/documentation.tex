\begin{abstract}
	There are several network player on the market, which all based on proprietary software. Because of this proprietary the network player is mostly uncomfortable in use and it is not usable from every network device. To improve this weakness the goal of this project is to build a network player which is controllable via the Music Player Daemon (MPD). MPD uses a extreme simple protocol which based on ascii Strings. This simple protocol allows to interact via a telnet client with the mpd server. The network player will get a own hard drive and will be able to play internet radio and audio from other sources.
